***************************************
Version pinning
***************************************

b2sdk is divided into three parts. Please pay attention to which group you use, as the stability of your application depends on correct pinning of versions.

++++++++++
Interfaces
++++++++++

Public
======

Public interface consists of *public* members of the following modules:

.. autosummary::
  :nosignatures:

  b2sdk.api.B2Api
  b2sdk.bucket.Bucket
  b2sdk.exception
  b2sdk.sync
  b2sdk.sync.exception
  b2sdk.account_info.abstract
  b2sdk.account_info.exception
  b2sdk.account_info.sqlite_account_info
  b2sdk.account_info.upload_url_pool
  b2sdk.transferer
  b2sdk.utils

Those will not change in a backwards-incompatible way between non-major versions. In other words, if you pin your dependencies to `>=x.0.0;<x+1.0.0`, everything should be ok.
In other words, if you pin your dependencies to

.. hint::
    If the current version of b2sdk is 4.5.6 and you only use the public interfaces, put this in your requirements.txt::

        b2sdk>=4.5.6,<5.0.0

.. note:: b2sdk.*._something and b2sdk.*.*._something, having a name which begins with an underscore, are NOT considred public interface.


Protected
=========

Things which sometimes might be necssary to use that are NOT considered public interface (and may change in a non-major version):

.. autosummary::
  :nosignatures:

  b2sdk.session.B2Session
  b2sdk.raw_api.B2RawApi
  b2sdk.b2http.B2Http

.. note:: it is ok for you to use those (better that, than copying our sources), however if you do, please pin your dependencies to middle version.

.. hint::
    If the current version of b2sdk is 4.5.6 and you use the public and protected interfaces, put this in your requirements.txt::

        b2sdk>=4.5.6,<4.6.0


Private
=======

If you need to use some of our private interfaces, pin your dependencies strictly.

.. hint::
    If the current version of b2sdk is 4.5.6 and you use the private interface, put this in your requirements.txt::

        b2sdk==4.5.6
